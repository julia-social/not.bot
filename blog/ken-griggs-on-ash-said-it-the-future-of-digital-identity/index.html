    <meta property="og:title" content="Ken Griggs on Ash Said It: The Future of Digital Identity">
    <meta property="og:description" content="Our CEO Ken Griggs recently joined Ash Brown on the Ash Said It Show for a timely conversation about digital identity, privacy, and the UK&#39;s proposed nationwide digital ID system. Here&#39;s what you need to know.

## The Big Question: Security or Surveillance?

When the UK government announced plans for a nationwide digital ID system, it sparked a global debate about the future of digital rights. On the surface, these systems promise convenience—easier access to public services, streamlined verification, reduced fraud. But as Ken explains in this eye-opening interview, the reality is far more complex.

&quot;When you centralize the identity of an entire nation in a single database, you&#39;re creating a high-risk honey pot for hackers and state actors,&quot; Ken warns. &quot;It&#39;s not a question of *if* it gets breached—it&#39;s *when*.&quot;

## Why Centralization Is Dangerous

During the 16-minute conversation, Ken breaks down three critical problems with centralized digital ID systems:

### 1. Single Point of Failure
When millions of identities live in one database, a single breach compromises everyone. We&#39;ve seen this play out with massive data breaches at Equifax, Target, and countless other centralized systems. Now imagine that, but with your government-issued identity.

### 2. Surveillance Potential
Centralized systems give governments unprecedented tracking capabilities. Every time you verify your identity, that action can be logged, tracked, and analyzed. This creates a detailed map of your daily life—where you go, what services you use, who you interact with.

### 3. Loss of Data Sovereignty
In centralized systems, you don&#39;t own your data—the institution does. You can&#39;t delete it. You can&#39;t control who sees it. You&#39;re entirely dependent on that institution to protect it, manage it, and not misuse it.

## The Decentralized Alternative

This is where Ken&#39;s work at not.bot and Julia Social comes in. As he explains to Ash, there&#39;s a better way:

**You own your identity. You control your data. You choose when and how to share it.**

Instead of storing everyone&#39;s information in a centralized database, decentralized identity uses cryptographic proofs. Your identity information lives on your device. When you need to verify yourself, you create a cryptographic signature that proves who you are—without revealing any underlying data.

It&#39;s the difference between showing your entire driver&#39;s license to prove you&#39;re over 21, versus simply proving the fact that you&#39;re over 21 without revealing your name, address, or photo.

## Why This Conversation Matters Now

The UK&#39;s digital ID legislation is being watched worldwide. If they implement a centralized system, other countries will follow. If they adopt a decentralized, privacy-preserving approach, it could set a new standard for digital rights globally.

As Ken tells Ash: &quot;The choices we make about digital identity today will determine what privacy looks like for the next generation. We can&#39;t afford to get this wrong.&quot;

- How blockchain technology enables decentralized identity
- Why &quot;convenience vs. privacy&quot; is a false choice
- Practical steps you can take to protect your digital identity today
